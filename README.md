# Connectome Project NJIT x Harvard University
NJIT summer 2024 research: Neuroscience connectome project using Arkouda

# Motifs
## Introductions
Motifs are recurring patterns within the brain's network. Our project aims to explore and identify the fundamental motifs or patterns within the brain's network architecture at the neural level. By leveraging advanced neuroimaging techniques and computational analysis, we seek to uncover the underlying structural and functional connectivity that supports the brain's vast array of cognitive functions.

## Project Overview
The Connectome Project is a collaborative research initiative between NJIT and Harvard University. Our goal is to investigate the brain's complex network architecture, focusing on identifying key motifs that facilitate efficient and diverse cognitive processes.

## Challenges of Counting Motifs in Large Graphs
* Combinatorial Complexity
* Symmetry and Redundancy
* Graph Isomorphism
* Efficient Algorithms
* Parallelization and Scalability
